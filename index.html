    I am a software engineer working at Apple on the Core OS - Machine Learning team. Previously, I built a <a href="http://www.raspberryturk.com">robot that can play chess</a> and before that I worked at <a href="https://www.livingsocial.com/mobile">LivingSocial</a> on the mobile team. In my spare time I love traveling across the world with my <a href="https://www.instagram.com/aworldoflavor/">wife</a>.
